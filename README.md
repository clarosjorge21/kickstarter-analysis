## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to see how different campaigns did on certain launch dates and their funding goals. By using this 
information Louise should be able to change her launch date by comparing it to the information and
ultimately meet her fundraising goal. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
One of the challenges I reached was on the Outcomes based on Goals sheet. 
I constantly was getting "0" when I finished the formula for the number successful, number failed, number canceled.
I went back to double check the formula and I made the mistake with the greater than and less than signs. 
Due to this the formula would come out incorrect due to not having any numbers in between.
The best way to solve this is to double check your work and make sure you completely understand the formula step by step.
By understanding the formula, you can see where your problem lies and have a solution.

The next problem I ran into was the number canceled being "0". Originally, since I had the first issue of me getting 0
on every other column I incorporated the solution I mentioned above. It still kept coming out 0, after many trials and errors 
I decided to actually take a look at the information and filter out what was needed. In the end, I found out that the answer
was actually 0. I think the most important part here is to look at situations in multiple point of views and don't just go with
the first answer you get. 


## Results

**- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?**
The first conclusion I came to from the Theater Outcomes based on Launch date is the month/season is extremely important.
If you take a look at the numbers of successful months you will notice that the highest is May, June, July. 
The first conclusion I made was that the spring and the summer season are the most successful most likely due to weather. 
To conclude, the warmer the months, the higher the ticket sales. 

The second conclusion I came to was that Febuary was higher than January and March while December is the lowest of them all.
I think we need to take in accordance the holidays as well. If we take Febuary, the reason why the month has the highest success between
all the winter months could be because of Valentines Day. Ticket sales probably go up around Febuary 14th as some couples would love to go to the theater.
Compared to December, where Christmas season is. Less people are trying to waste money on tickets for the theater due to the fact that they may have to buy gifts.
To conclude, we must keep in mind all major holidays while having a launch date. 
More people want to go out during Valentines season compared to Christmas season where they will want to save. 


**- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?**
The conclusion that I received from the Outcomes based on Goals is that the higher the goal, the higher the chance of it failing. 
If you look at "less than 1000" and "1000 to 4999", you can see they both have an above 70% success rate.
The success rate then seems to drop the higher the Goal goes. 
By keeping the goal lower, we can ensure a higher success of total projects. 
If we do decide to go higher in goal then we should lower the amount of projects compared to the ones we have now.
The outliers are "35000 to 39999" and "45000 to 44999" at 66.7% are high due to having 6 and 3 projects.
By keeping the projects low, we were able to have a high success rate.

**- What are some limitations of this dataset?**
One of the limitations of this dataset is the fact that we don't have what specific dates are more popular compared to others.
For example, my theory in the Theater Outcomes by Launch date that Febuary is busy by Valentines Day would be supported if 
we saw a majority of the launch was around the Febuary 14th date. Another time we could use that data is in the seasons theory, 
where we can see if the outcomes were more successful towards the end of April and beginning of July compared to the rest of the month. 

Another limitation of this dataset is that we don't know why shows were canceled. Is there a specific reason why it was canceled?
Was it because the forecast didn't match? We weren't given enough information in this part to use. 

**- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?**
Two other charts that I think we could use are bar charts or column charts if we would like to look at the overall picture 
for the theater outcomes by launch date. You would be able to see the information side by side for every month.
If we are looking at outcomes based on Goals I feel like we can use a pie chart if we
just want to look at one point of the data. For example, if we want to look at just the number of successful, we can compare using a pie chart 
to see the difference between them all and vice versa for number failed. We could also use a pie chart if we want to do a singular, for example, any less than 1000 
and having the pie chart show the percentage succeessful vs percentage failed.
